Quickstart
==========

   >>> import ads
   >>> ads.config.token = 'secret token'
   >>> papers = ads.SearchQuery(q="supernova", sort="citation_count")
   >>> for paper in papers:
   >>>    print(paper.title)
   [u'Maps of Dust Infrared Emission for Use in Estimation of Reddening and Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation Foregrounds']
   [u'Measurements of Omega and Lambda from 42 High-Redshift Supernovae']
   [u'Observational Evidence from Supernovae for an Accelerating Universe and a Cosmological Constant']
   [u'First-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Determination of Cosmological Parameters']
   [u'Abundances of the elements: Meteoritic and solar']
